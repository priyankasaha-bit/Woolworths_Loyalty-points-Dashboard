📊 **Key Insights**

I was flabbergasted to see- shoppers at Woolworths, Sydney's largest supermarket, rack up loyalty points on big spends — but mysteriously leave them unclaimed at the counter.
As I started working on the 3-Page Power BI suite, I drew some strange but meaningful insights …. Let me share those with you…..
 -In 2023–24, Woolworths customers earned 874K loyalty points on $876K in purchases — yet redeemed a mere 4.79%, highlighting major untapped reward value.

 -Manly and Campbelltown stores have the highest redemption rates. This could stem from the fact that local promotions are influencing customer behaviour.

 -The month of October (for both 2023-24) has the highest variability and mean in transaction amounts, due to seasonal campaigns or pre-holiday spikes, but unfortunately in both years the points redeemed for the same month is less than 7%.

 -556 high-value transactions (>$400) are computed which had no redemption at all.

 -Majority of customers didn’t redeem a single loyalty point may be due to lack of awareness or reward fatigue. Bruce Coffey was the only one who could redeem roughly 40% of 1289 points earned.
At times, customer behaviour defies logic — turning a blind eye to clear opportunities, like unredeemed rewards that could’ve brought instant value.
