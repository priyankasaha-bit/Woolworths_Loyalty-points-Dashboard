# Woolworths_Loyalty-points-Dashboard
Created a loyalty analytics dashboard for Woolies, Sydney’s largest supermarket, to track points earned vs. redeemed. The dashboard provides insights based on store locations, customer names, and other key criteria, supporting strategies to enhance customer retention and engagement.
I was flabbergasted to see- shoppers at Woolworths, Sydney's largest supermarket,  rack up loyalty points on big spends — but mysteriously leave them unclaimed at the counter.
As I started working on the 3-Page Power BI suite, I drew some strange but meaningful insights …. Let me share those with you…..
 	-In 2023–24, Woolworths customers earned 874K loyalty points on $876K in purchases — yet redeemed a mere 4.79%, highlighting major untapped reward value.

 	-Manly and Campbelltown stores have the highest redemption rates. This could stem from the fact that local promotions are influencing customer behaviour.

 	-The month of October (for both 2023-24) has the highest variability and mean in transaction amounts, due to seasonal campaigns or pre-holiday spikes, but unfortunately in both years the points redeemed for the same month is less than 7%.

 	-556 high-value transactions (>$400) are computed which had no redemption at all.

 	-Majority of customers didn’t redeem a single loyalty point may be due to lack of awareness or reward fatigue. Bruce Coffey was the only one who could redeem roughly 40% of 1289 points earned.
  
At times, customer behaviour defies logic — turning a blind eye to clear opportunities, like unredeemed rewards that could’ve brought instant value.
